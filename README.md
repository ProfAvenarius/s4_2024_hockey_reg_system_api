THe game object and its functionality has been added to the Hockey League Admin System. In addition to the base requirements, all routes used in the existing objects have been added the game - a full suite of GET routes, includeing search with a 
query parameter. THe project also explores some Spring functionality by including a DataLoader and a modified application.properties file which creates the MySQL database and initializes it with testdata. THis was incredibly easy with the Spring 
annotations and interfaces.

Progam was writen on IntelliJ, with Postman used to test all API routes.
